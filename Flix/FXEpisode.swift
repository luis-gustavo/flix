 Used as a funnel where you can customized the game's logic and perform chained actions when some episode is watched/event is sent.
 
 This is the main type of the framework. Even though it is a protocol, it was created to be used as an enumeration where each case
 represents an episode. So your implementation is a bucket if episodes that can or not be called in order.
 
 Futhermore, you can also implements lifecyle methods to know when a season starts or ends. You have all the information you will need
 to perform some logic in
 
     func viewer(_: FXViewer, wannaWatch: FXEpisode, from: FXNumber, at: FXScreen, with: FXSettings, afterFinish: @escaping (FXWhatNext) -> Void)

     Called when an episode will be watched by a viewer. The viewer is an entity on screen and the episode is an event that must handled.
     
     After you finish handling the episode, you must call this method to allow you receive more events. All events sent when an episode is being
     handled are ignored.
     
     
     - Parameter viewer: The object that has thrown the episode event.
     - Parameter episode: What episode should be executed.
     - Parameter season: The season that is being executed.
     - Parameter screen: Where the game is being executed.
     - Parameter setting: Configuration used to present the series and some more logic.
     - Parameter afterFinish: a closure that must be called when you finish handling this episode.
     - Parameter whatNext: what should happen after this episode is handled.
