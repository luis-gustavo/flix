 A chunk of data that represents something that happened in the game. Normally
 this chunks are created by user's interactions.
 
 - Warning: you should create an instance of this type immediately after the data
 happened.
 
 This type implements the 3W Data Pattern used to generalized all data recorded
 for every game. So you should read about that documentation to know how to
 create instances of this type.
 
 When you create a chunk, the **when** is created inside the initializer automatically.
